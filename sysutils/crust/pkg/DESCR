Libre SCP firmware for Allwinner sunxi SoCs.

Crust improves battery life and thermal performance by implementing a
deep sleep state. During deep sleep, the CPU cores, the DRAM
controller, and most onboard peripherals are powered down, reducing
power consumption by 80% or more compared to an idle device. On boards
without a PMIC, Crust is also responsible for orderly power-off and
power-on of the device.

This package provides SCP firware builds for boards supported by
OpenBSD.
