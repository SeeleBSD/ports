| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Config File
===========

When using the included rc.d(8) script, ${PKGSTEM} uses the config file at
`${SYSCONFDIR}/navidrome.toml`.

Adding Music
=============

Music can be added by copying it to `${LOCALSTATEDIR}/navidrome/music/` or
by changing `MusicFolder` in the config file.

Web Interface
=============

By default, ${PKGSTEM} serves up a web interface on:

	 http://127.0.0.1:4533

If you wish to listen on a different address, change the `Address` setting in
the config file.

Jukebox Mode
============

${PKGSTEM} supports Subsonic's "Jukebox mode", where audio is played through
the server's audio hardware, instead of being streamed to the client.

This requires a client that supports jukebox mode (the built-in web interface
does not).

To use jukebox mode, install mpv (multimedia/mpv), set `Jukebox.Enabled = true`
in the config file, and make sure that the `_navidrome` user can play audio via
sndio.
