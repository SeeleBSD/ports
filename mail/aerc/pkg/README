| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

aerc's Maildir support on BSD uses kqueue(2), which is really intended for
watching individual files rather than large directories or trees. It requires
a file handle to be opened for each file in the monitored directories, which
will soon exceed default limits in the system.

It is therefore recommended to run an IMAP daemon (for example Dovecot,
courier-imap, imap-uw) and connect over IMAP, even if this is just to the
local machine.
