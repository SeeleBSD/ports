mairix is a program for indexing and searching email messages stored in
Maildir, MH or mbox folders, or on an IMAP server. (Note that TLS
support is currently disabled due to a problem with certificate
validation, so it is recommended only to use this on localhost).

The search mode populates a "virtual" folder with symlinks which point
to the real messages which can be opened as usual in your mail program.
