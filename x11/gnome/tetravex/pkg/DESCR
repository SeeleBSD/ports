The game window is divided into two boxes: the one on the right side of
the window contains the pieces that needs to be arranged; the one on the
left side of the window is where the pieces from the right box will be
arranged and moved. Each piece is divided into four little triangles
containing a number.

The scope of the game is to position the pieces so that only two
identical numbers are next to each other.

It is not possible to position the pieces so that different number are
next to each other.

The game is completed when you have positioned all the pieces in their
right positions.
