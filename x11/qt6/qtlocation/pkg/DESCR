The Qt Location module helps you create mapping solutions using data available
from popular location service providers, such as Open Street Map.

The Qt Location API enables you to:

 - Access and present map data.
 - Support touch gesture on a specific area of the map.
 - Query for a specific geographical location and route.
 - Add additional layers on top, such as polylines and circles.
 - Search for places and related images.
