This plugin allows you to setup and use multiple keyboard layouts.

You can choose the keyboard model, what key combination to
use to switch between the layouts, the actual keyboard layouts,
the way in which the current layout is being displayed (country
flag image or text) and the layout policy, which is whether to
store the layout globally (for all windows), per application or
per window.

The plugin detects any change in the layout configuration
(e.g. setxkbmap invocations) and reconfigures itself to use
the new settings.

There is a hidden (not available in the GUI) setting -
"never_modify_config". If this setting is set to "true" in
the configuration file, then the plugin will not modify the
layout configuration under any circumstances (currently
even when the configuration is modified through the settings
dialog). This option is for users who wish to configure
some XKB options, which are not present in the GUI and thus
are limited by the plugin. These users can use the plugin
so that it only displays the active layouts.
