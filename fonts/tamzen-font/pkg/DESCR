Tamzen is a fork of the Tamsyn bitmapped console font.

It's programmatically forked from Tamsyn version 1.11 by the Rakefile
script which backports glyphs from older versions while deleting
deliberately empty glyphs (which serve as unimplemented markers) to
allow secondary fallback fonts to provide real glyphs at those code
points.

The "TamzenForPowerline" fonts contain additional Powerline symbols.
