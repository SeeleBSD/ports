Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive
documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior.
It builds on the legacy of HyperCard and the visual aesthetic of
classic MacOS.  It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that
HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life
improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and
touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing
operations.
