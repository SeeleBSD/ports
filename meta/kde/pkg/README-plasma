| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD

X11 Startup
===========
KDE Plasma desktop environment is launched through the 'startplasma-x11'
executable. Simply add '${LOCALBASE}/bin/startplasma-x11' to your .xinitrc
or .xsession script if you use startx(1) or xenodm(1), respectively. You can
find an example below. The 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' should be present before calling
'startplasma-x11'

export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/run/$(id -u)
if [ ! -d $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR ]; then
    mkdir -m 700 -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
fi

export QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING=1
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE
export DESKTOP_SESSION=plasma
${LOCALBASE}/bin/startplasma-x11 > ~/.startplasma-x11.log 2>&1

Logging out and shutting down the computer
==========================================
If your user is part of the _shutdown group and thus can execute shutdown(8),
you should be able to shutdown/logout without further configuration.

Otherwise, halting and rebooting from KDE Plasma require consolekit2 and
polkit-kde-agent: you'll need to run a systemwide D-BUS service (# rcctl enable
messagebus) and start with 'startplasma-x11' with
'${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session':

${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${LOCALBASE}/bin/startplasma-x11

If you don't want to use messagebus/polkit-kde-agent, you can still configure
doas(1) to allow your user to run shutdown/halt -p without having to enter a
password, and create a launcher executing 'doas shutdown -p' (or doas halt -p).

Power management
================
If you use KDE Plasma on a laptop, make sure that the powerdevil package
is installed, which will provide battery levels/information, and will
allow to configure actions upon low battery level or AC plugging. For
proper function, it requires messagebus and upowerd running. If using
consolekit2 and polkit-kde-agent, it will also allow you to suspend the
laptop from the logout dialog.

Screen compositor
=================
The KDE compositor may not run properly by default. You can deactivate it
under: "System Setting" -> "Display Configuration" -> "Compositor" or
in `~/.config/kwinrc":

[Compositing]
Enabled=false

It is also possible to use a window manager other than KWin with Plasma.

export KDEWM=${LOCALBASE}/bin/picom

Desktop search
==============
Baloo file indexer is disabled by default on OpenBSD. To enable it go to
"Search" -> "File Search in system settings or execute:

${LOCALBASE}/bin/balooctl enable

Wayland
=======
The KDE Plasma Wayland support is currently experimental and **does not work
out-of-box yet**. You can use the following script to test it:

#! /bin/sh

export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/run/$(id -u)
if [ ! -d $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR ]; then
    mkdir -m 700 -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
fi

# You can try and play with this options:
#export WLR_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/card0
#export LIBSEAT_BACKEND=noop
#export XCURSOR_THEME=redglass
#export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
#export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland

${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session dbus-run-session \
 ${LOCALBASE}/bin/startplasma-wayland

Known issues
============
- You can't unlock your session when the screensaver has locked it. I get the
  graphical message "Something wrong happened. Run # ck-unlock-session ...".
  So you will end up with a freezen session that you have to completely kill.
  **It is recommended to disable KDE screen locking** for now.
- The first start may take a little longer.
- The sound mixer Kmix works only on the main channel.

Please help to improve this situation and report what works well and what does
not. So that issues are known and a solution can be worked on. Please provide
reports with debugging information:

You can also output all error/info messages by starting `startplasma-x11` with
the following options and provide a full error log.
