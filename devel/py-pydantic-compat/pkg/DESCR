This package provides (unofficial) compatibility mixins and function
adaptors for pydantic v1-v2 cross compatibility. It allows you to
use either v1 or v2 API names, regardless of the pydantic version
installed. (Prefer using v2 names when possible).

Pydantic 2 was a major release that completely changed the pydantic API.

For applications, this is not a big deal, as they can pin to whatever
version of pydantic they need. But for libraries that want to exist
in a broader environment, pinning to a specific version of pydantic
is not always an option (as it limits the ability to co-exist with
other libraries).
