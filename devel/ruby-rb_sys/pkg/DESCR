The primary goal of rb-sys is to make building native Ruby extensions in
Rust easier than it would be in C. If it's not easy, it's a bug.

Features:

* Battle-tested Rust bindings for the Ruby C API
* Support for Ruby 2.4+
* Supports all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Cross compilation of gems
* Integration with rake-compiler
