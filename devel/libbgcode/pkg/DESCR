libbgcode is a library to operate (read / write / convert) on Binary
G-Code, which is a new G-code file format featuring the following
improvements over the legacy G-code:

1. Block structure with distinct blocks for metadata vs. G-code

2. Faster navigation

3. Coding & compression for smaller file size

4. Checksum for data validity

5. Extensivity through new (custom) blocks. For example, a file
signature block may be welcome by corporate customers.
