phpPgAdmin can manage a whole PostgreSQL server (needs a super-user)
as well as a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
properly set up PostgreSQL user who can read/write only the desired
database. It's up to you to look up the appropriate part in the
PostgreSQL manual.

This package uses a fork of phpPgAdmin; the original version has not
been updated to support recent PostgreSQL or PHP.
