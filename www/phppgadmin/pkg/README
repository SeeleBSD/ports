| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

phpPgAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

You may want to link this under the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../phpPgAdmin /var/www/htdocs/phpPgAdmin
(use a relative symlink - web servers on OpenBSD are typically chrooted).

Configure your database(s) in ${INSTDIR}/conf/config.inc.php
as necessary.

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/phpPgAdmin/index.php
