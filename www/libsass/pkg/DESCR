Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins,
selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to well-formatted,
standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your build
system.

LibSass is a C++ port of the original Ruby Sass CSS compiler with a
C API, coded with portability and efficiency in mind. You can expect
LibSass to be a lot faster than Ruby Sass and on par or faster than
the best alternative CSS compilers around.

Warning: LibSass is deprecated. While it will continue to receive
maintenance releases indefinitely, there are no plans to add additional
features or compatibility with any new CSS or Sass features. Projects
that still use it should move onto Dart Sass.
