wpa_supplicant is the implementation of an IEEE 802.1X supplicant for
wired (Ethernet PAE) and wireless (WPA/WPA2) authentication.

Flavour: openssl (built against OpenSSL instead of LibreSSL)
- supports older TLS protocols which may be needed in order to
connect to some insecure networks with obsolete authentication
servers (see pkg-readme).
