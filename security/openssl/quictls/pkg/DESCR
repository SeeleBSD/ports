This is a fork of OpenSSL to enable QUIC with the BoringSSL QUIC API
everyone else uses while OpenSSL are busy implementing a worse API.

This package is not intended for general-purpose use in OpenBSD - it
is present for test/comparison purposes. Do not use this as a dependency.
If your application uses the BoringSSL QUIC API it should use LibreSSL if
at all possible, otherwise use BoringSSL.
