Create a watch list file ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/certspotter/.certspotter/watchlist
containing the DNS names you want to monitor, one per line. To monitor an
entire domain tree (including the domain itself and all sub-domains) prefix the
domain (including the domain itself and all sub-domains) prefix the domain name
with a dot (e.g. .example.com). To monitor a single DNS name only, do not
prefix the name with a dot.

Place one or more email addresses in
${LOCALSTATEDIR}/certspotter/.certspotter/email_recipients file
(one per line), and/or place one or more executable scripts in
${LOCALSTATEDIR}/certspotter/.certspotter/hooks.d directory. certspotter
will email the listed addresses (requires your system to have a working
sendmail command) and execute the provided scripts when it detects a
certificate for a domain on your watch list. The location of those files is
kept in a .certspotter to ensure compatibility with the non daemonized
version.
