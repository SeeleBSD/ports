Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor from SSLMate that alerts
you when an SSL/TLS certificate is issued for one of your domains.
Cert Spotter is easier to use than other open source CT monitors, since it does
not require a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.

You can use Cert Spotter to detect:

- Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised your DNS
  and are redirecting your visitors to their malicious site.
- Certificates issued to attackers who have taken over an abandoned
  sub-domain in order to serve malware under your name.
- Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
  authority and want to impersonate your site.
- Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy or outside
  of your centralized certificate procurement process.

N.B. Cert Spotter fetches the entire set of CT logs, using a large
amount of bandwidth while doing so, possibly for a week or more.
