Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is an object-oriented C++ class
library designed for rapid production of sophisticated domain-specific
CAD/CAM/CAE applications.

A typical application developed using OCCT deals with two or
three-dimensional (2D or 3D) geometric modeling in general-purpose
or specialized Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems, manufacturing
or analysis applications, simulation applications, or even illustration
tools.
