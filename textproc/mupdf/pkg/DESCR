MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer.

Support includes PDF 1.7 (with transparency, encryption, hyperlinks,
annotations, searching and more), epub, xps, cbz, mobi, fb2, various
image types (including svg, png, jpg, bmp, jpeg, tiff), and has basic
support for MSOffice XML formats (docx, xlsx, pptx).

The renderer is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a
pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page
on screen.

The mutool command line tool supports multiple arguments, including
"show" to print and examine objects in a PDF file, "clean" to decompress
and pretty-print the streams and objects in PDF files and also to
extract individual pages, "info" to display information about objects,
"extract" to extract individual objects, "poster" to split a large
page into many tiles, and "draw" to render documents to image files
(pbm/pgm/ppm/pam/png/pcl and others).

Flavours:
	js - build with JavaScript support (using the MuJS interpreter;
		this includes the OpenGL-based renderer "mupdf-gl")
