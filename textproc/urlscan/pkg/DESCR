Urlscan is a small program that is designed to integrate with the
"mutt" mailreader to allow you to easily launch a Web browser for URLs
contained in email messages. It is a replacement for the "urlview"
program.

Relative to urlview, urlscan has the following additional features:

* Support for emails in quoted-printable and base64 encodings. No more
  stripping out =40D from URLs by hand!

* The context of each URL is provided along with the URL. For HTML
  mails, a crude parser is used to render the HTML into text. Context
  view can be toggled on/off with c.

* URLs are shortened by default to fit on one line. Viewing full URL
  (for one or all) is toggled with s or S.

* Jump to a URL by typing the number.

* Incremental case-insensitive search with /.

* Execute an arbitrary function (for example, copy URL to clipboard)
  instead of opening URL in a browser.

* Use l to cycle through whether URLs are opened using the Python
  webbrowser module (default), xdg-open (if installed) or opened by a
  function passed on the command line with --run or --run-safe.

* Configure colors and keybindings via ~/.config/urlscan/config.json.
  Generate default config file for editing by running urlscan -g. Cycle
  through available palettes with p. Set display width with --width.

* Copy URL to clipboard with C or to primary selection with P. Requires
  xsel or xclip.

* Run a command with the selected URL as the argument or pipe the
  selected URL to a command.

* Show complete help menu with F1. Hide header on startup with --nohelp.

* Use a custom regular expression with -E for matching urls or any other
  pattern. In junction with -r, this effectively turns urlscan into a
  general purpose CLI selector-type utility.

* Scan certain email headers for URLs. Currently Link, Archived-At and
  List-* are scanned when --headers is passed.

* Queue multiple URLs for opening and open them all at once with a and o.
