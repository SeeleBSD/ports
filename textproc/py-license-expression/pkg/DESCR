license-expression is a comprehensive utility library to parse, compare,
simplify and normalize license expressions (such as SPDX license
expressions) using boolean logic.

Software project licenses are often a combination of several free and
open source software licenses. License expressions -- as specified by
SPDX -- provide a concise and human readable way to express these
licenses without having to read long license texts, while still being
machine-readable.
