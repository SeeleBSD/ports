Apertium-recursive is an alternative to apertium-transfer,
apertium-interchunk, and apertium-postchunk. It uses a GLR parser rather
than chunking and so can apply rules recursively. Rules can be written in a
format almost identical to that of apertium-transfer or in a somewhat
Yacc-like format created for this purpose.
