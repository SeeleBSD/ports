| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart
==========

IRCTk uses an external program to connect to the IRC server.  On
OpenBSD, nc(1) can be used.  When adding a server, use something like:

	nc -c irc.libera.chat 6697

as the "Connection string".

Authentication with CertFP can be done by setting an empty password and
using the nc(1) -C and -K flags.

There's a comprensive quickstart guide available at:
<https://lab.abiscuola.com/irctk/doc/1.0.0/www/wiki/quickstart.wiki>


Extensions
==========

Some extensions are installed in ${PREFIX}/share/irctk/extensions/ and
are not enabled automatically.  Read their README files to see what they
do.  The extensions often have dependencies on other programs.

Use "Edit" -> "Extensions" and then the "Load" button to load an
extension.
