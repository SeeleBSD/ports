The rpkitouch utility sets the last data modification time of file to
the timestamp internal to the contained RPKI object. Deterministic
timestamps help minimize RP synchronisation times.

This utility is useful for RPKI Publication Point operators who
serialize RPKI objects from data sources lacking file modification
times (like RRDP) to a disk hierachy for public consumption via RSYNC.
