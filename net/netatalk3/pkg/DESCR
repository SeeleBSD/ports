Netatalk is a Free and Open Source file server that implements the Apple Filing 
rotocol (AFP; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol) 3.4 over
TCP/IP.
AFP is the primary file sharing protocol used on Apple II, Classic Mac OS, and
Mac OS X, as well as one of several supported protocols on macOS.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk provides high-speed AppleShare file sharing
for macOS and Classic Mac OS clients.

If you need Netatalk to provide AFP over AppleTalk (DDP) in order to do file
sharing with very old Macs or Apple II computers, please install the old stable
netatalk-2.x package.
AppleTalk support was removed in Netatalk 3.0, however 2.x is still being
actively maintained.
