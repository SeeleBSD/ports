Trippy combines the functionality of traceroute and ping (supporting
ICMP, UDP, TCP over IPv4 and IPv6) and is designed to assist with the
analysis of networking issues.

Customizable tracing options:
    packet size & payload pattern
    start and maximum time-to-live (TTL)
    minimum and maximum round duration
    round end grace period & maximum number of unknown hops
    source & destination port (TCP & UDP)
    source address and source interface
    TOS (aka DSCP + ECN)
Identification of Equal Cost Multi-path Routing
RFC4884 ICMP Multi-Part Messages
    Generic Extension Objects
    MPLS Label Stacks
Tui (curses-style) interface:
    Trace multiple targets simultaneously from a single instance
    Per hop stats (sent, rcvd, loss%, last, avg, best, worst, stddev & status)
    Per hop round-trip-time (RTT) history and frequency distributing charts
    Interactive chart of RTT for all hops in a trace with zooming capability
    Interactive GeoIp world map (needs local mmdb files)
    Isolate and filter by individual tracing flows
    Customizable color theme & key bindings
    Show multiple hosts per hop
    Show hop details and navigate hosts within each hop
    Responsive UI with adjustable refresh rate
DNS:
    Lazy reverse DNS queries
    Lookup autonomous system number (ASN) and name
Generate tracing reports:
    json, csv & tabular (pretty-printed and markdown)
    Tracing flows report
    Graphviz dot charts
    configurable reporting cycles
