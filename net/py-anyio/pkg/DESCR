AnyIO is a asynchronous compatibility API that allows applications and libraries
written against it to run unmodified on asyncio, curio and trio.

It bridges the following functionality:
- Task groups
- Cancellation
- Threads
- Signal handling
- Asynchronous file I/O
- Subprocesses
- Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions, events,
  semaphores, object streams)
- High level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)
