DOSBox-X is a fork of DOSBox cross-platform DOS emulator.

This is a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the
environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those
versions of Windows. Moreover, DOSBox-X supports DOS/V and NEC PC-98
emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.

Compared with DOSBox, DOSBox-X focuses more on general emulation and accuracy.
The goal of this project is to make a complete emulation package that covers
all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based system scenarios, including peripherals,
motherboards, CPUs, and all manner of hardware that was made for PC hardware
of that time.
