By default, the UI assets are not available (icons in menus), you can
download them from Retroarch:

  Main Menu -> Online Updater -> Update assets


If Retroarch does not offer a core when you try to load a content,
although the according core is installed, it is recommended to create
a playlist:

  Import content -> Manual Scan

    - choose a content directory
    - choose a default core for the files in this directory
    - Start Scan
