FLINT is a C library for doing number theory, freely available under
the GNU LGPL.

At its core, FLINT provides arithmetic in standard rings such as the
integers, rationals, algebraic, real, complex and p-adic numbers,
finite fields, and number fields. It also provides polynomials
(univariate and multivariate), power series, and matrices.

FLINT covers a wide range of functionality: primality testing, integer
factorisation, multivariate polynomial GCD and factorisation, FFTs,
multimodular reconstruction, special functions, exact and approximate
linear algebra, LLL, finite field embeddings, and more.
