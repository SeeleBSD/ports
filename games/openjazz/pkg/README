OpenJazz
========
OpenJazz requires the original game files from Jazz Jackrabbit to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

The Windows version from GOG.com can be extracted with innoextract.
The Linux version from GOG.com can be extracted with unzip.

The files will be extracted into the current working directory. The
directory can be renamed and moved to a location of your choosing. You
can delete all non-game related files that are extracted from the exe.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Jazz Jackrabbit, which is not
open source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this
package.
