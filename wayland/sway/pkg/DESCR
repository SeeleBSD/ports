sway is an i3-compatible Wayland compositor.

Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to
`~/.config/sway/config` and it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy
the sample configuration file to `~/.config/sway/config`. It is
usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.  Run `man 5 sway` for
information on the configuration.

Running

On OpenBSD, use the provided /usr/local/bin/startsway.sh script to
launch sway from an text VT (xenodm must be stopped).  Customize it to
your needs
