A library to write GTK applications that use Layer Shell. Layer Shell
is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels,
notifications and wallpapers. You can use it to anchor your windows to
a corner or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output.

It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and popovers (GTK
popups Just Work).
