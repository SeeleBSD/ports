libei is a library for Emulated Input, primarily aimed at the Wayland stack.
It uses a typical client/server separation, with the two parts connected via a
UNIX socket.
In libei parlance, the client-side is called "EI client", the server side,
typically a Wayland compositor, is called the "EIS Implementation" (Emulated
Input Server). These terms are used throughout this documentation.
